# MACD TRADING STRATEGY RESEARCH

==============================

This project was created to learn how to create trading algorithms and analyzing the performance of said algorithms. Using optimization functions we also aim to find the optimal trading stategy for any given stock using the MACD measure.


This project was created in Google Colab
==============================

To set up this file you must install the following libraries:
==============================

backtesting -> eg: !pip install backtesting
yfinance -> eg: !pip install yfinance
ta-lib -> eg: !curl -L http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz -O && tar xzvf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
pandas -> eg: pip install pandas
numpy -> eg: pip install numpy
matplotlib -> eg: pip install -U matplotlib
plotly -> eg: $ pip install plotly==5.11.0


If these libraries are not installed, run the first cell
===============================

For more information on backtesting library visit: https://pypi.org/project/Backtesting/


Optimization functions will take a while, tested on Colab resulted in 3 minute wait times minimum
